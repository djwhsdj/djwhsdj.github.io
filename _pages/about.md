I am currently pursuing a combined M.S./Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University. My research focuses on `mapping Deep/Convolutional Neural Networks (D/CNNs) onto In-Memory Computing (IMC) architectures to enable energy-efficient and high-speed D/CNN inference`. Recently, I have expanded my research interests to `Large Language Models (LLMs)`, aiming to optimize their performance and inference efficiency in IMC systems. To achieve this, I am exploring various hardware-aware optimization techniques, including mapping, dataflow, and model compression.


<! Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. 

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
