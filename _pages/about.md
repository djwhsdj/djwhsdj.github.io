I am currently pursuing a combined M.S./Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University. My research focuses on `mapping Deep/Convolutional Neural Networks (D/CNNs) onto In-Memory Computing (IMC) architectures to enable energy-efficient and high-speed D/CNN inference`. Recently, I have expanded my research interests to `Large Language Models (LLMs)`, aiming to optimize their performance and inference efficiency in IMC systems. To achieve this, I am exploring various hardware-aware optimization techniques, including mapping, dataflow, and model compression.
